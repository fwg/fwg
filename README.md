### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

The web has had me in its clutches for almost two decades by now. 
Most of that time I have worked for agencies that weren't that keen on open source, so don't expect a ton of repositories here.

Some hot takes to keep you entertained:

ðŸ¤¡ Your JS app is not morally superior because you have a 3 minute compile-run loop.

ðŸš€ PHP will still dominate the web when you wipe your grandkids' arses.

ðŸ‘€ Don't build a distributed system if you have a monolithic organisation.
